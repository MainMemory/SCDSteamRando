Place OGG files in this folder to include them in the pool for the music randomizer. You may place files in folders named "US" and "JP" to make them specific to a certain soundtrack, and in any number of sub-folders beyond that.
To have custom loop points, you can create a file named MusicLoops.ini, which will list the file paths starting from this folder using forward slashes for folders, followed by an equals sign and the sample number to start the loop at in decimal.

Example:
S1/GreenHill.ogg=635050
S2/MysticCave.ogg=99356
